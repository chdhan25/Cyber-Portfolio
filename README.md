# Cyber-Portfolio

Hello 👋 I’m Daniel Han.

I recently graduated in Spring ’25 from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in Computer Science. I'm passionate about cybersecurity and currently building my skills through hands-on projects, certifications, and continuous learning.
This GitHub is where I document my growth — you'll find:

🚨 Cybersecurity labs (TryHackMe, home lab setups, CTFs)

🔐 Writeups and research on recent news, vulnerabilities, tools, and threats

💻 Code projects and automations related to security and scripting

I'm excited to keep learning, sharing, and breaking (then fixing) things.
